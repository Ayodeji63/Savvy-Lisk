## Overview

SavvyCircle addresses the financial inclusion challenges faced by small business owners in Africa. By utilizing smart contracts on the blockchain, the platform allows users to form savings groups, contribute funds, and access loans in a transparent and automated manner. The use of decentralized technology eliminates the need for centralized bodies, ensuring transparency and trust in group savings and lending activities.

## Features

- **Group Creation**: Users can create or join savings groups, easily managed within Telegram.
- **Regular Savings**: Members contribute a fixed amount to their group's pool on a recurring basis.
- **Automated Loan Distribution**: Loans are distributed to eligible members based on their contribution history and credit score, using smart contracts.
- **Flexible Repayment**: Members repay loans over time with a small interest rate, tracked automatically by the contract.
- **Transparent Operations**: Every transaction is recorded on-chain, providing full visibility and accountability.
- **Chainlink Integration**: Chainlink Automation ensures timely and trustless loan distribution, guaranteeing fairness in the lending process.

## Smart Contract

The core of SavvyCircle is the `SavvySavings` smart contract. Key components include:

- **ERC20 Token**: Users can deposit and withdraw tokens that represent their contributions or loans.
- **Group Management**: Smart contracts facilitate group creation, user enrollment, and contribution tracking.
- **Loan Mechanism**: Loans are automatically distributed based on preset conditions (e.g., contributions, repayment history).
- **Repayment Tracking**: The contract keeps track of outstanding loans and repayments with built-in penalties for late payments.
- **Chainlink Automation**: Automates critical processes like loan distribution to ensure no central authority is required to handle operations.

## How It Works

1. **Group Formation**: Users create or join a savings group on Telegram.
2. **Regular Contributions**: Members make periodic contributions to the group pool.
3. **Loan Distribution**:
   - Loans are distributed when conditions are met. The contract calculates the eligible amount based on the user's contributions and credit score.
   - Loans are distributed in two phases for better risk management.
4. **Repayment**: Members repay loans over a set period (e.g., 3 months) with a minimal interest rate.
5. **Credit Scoring**: Members' repayment behavior contributes to their on-chain credit score, impacting their eligibility for future loans.
6. **Cycle Continuation**: After successful loan repayment, the group can start a new savings and lending cycle.
